# Week 2 - Day 1

### 1. Write a version of insertion sort that sorts an array of many types instead of numbers.

Requirements: 
- Sorts the following types: boolean, numbers, strings
- Sorts types by complexity: Boolean -> Numbers -> Strings

HINTS:
- You can use > and < to compare strings. 
- or you can use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare
- check types: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof

### 2. Extend `LinkedList` to a data structure called `SuperLinkedList`.
  - a. Add a swap function that swaps any two nodes in the Linked List. Write tests.
  - b. Add a pure function that reverses a Linked List. Write tests.
